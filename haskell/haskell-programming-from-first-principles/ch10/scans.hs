module Scans where

fibs = 1 : scanl (+) 1 fibs

-- Scans Exercises
-- 1. Modify your fibs function to only return the first 20 Fibonacci numbers.
fibs20 = take 20 fibs

-- 2. Modify fibs to return the Fibonacci numbers that are less than 100.
fibsLt100 = takeWhile (< 100) fibs

-- 3. Try to write the factorial function from Recursion as a scan. Youâ€™ll want scanl again, and your start value will be 1. Warning: this will also generate an infinite list, so you may want to pass it through a take function or similar.
factorial = scanl (*) 1 [2..]
-- usage: take 5 factorial
