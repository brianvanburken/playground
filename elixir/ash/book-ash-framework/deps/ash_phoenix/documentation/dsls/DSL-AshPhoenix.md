# DSL: AshPhoenix

An extension to add form builders to the code interface.

There is currently no DSL for this extension.

This defines a `form_to_<name>` function for each code interface
function. Positional arguments are ignored, given that in forms,
all input typically comes from the `params` map.

The generated function passes all options through to
`AshPhoenix.Form.for_action/3`

Update and destroy actions take the record being updated/destroyed
as the first argument.

For example, given this code interface definition on a domain
called `MyApp.Accounts`:

```elixir
resources do
  resource MyApp.Accounts.User do
    define :register_with_password, args: [:email, :password]
    define :update_user, action: :update, args: [:email, :password]
  end
end
```

Adding the `AshPhoenix` extension would define 
`form_to_register_with_password/2`.

## Usage

Without options:

```elixir
MyApp.Accounts.form_to_register_with_password()
#=> %AshPhoenix.Form{}
```

With options:

```elixir
MyApp.Accounts.form_to_register_with_password(params: %{"email" => "placeholder@email"})
#=> %AshPhoenix.Form{}
```

With 

```elixir
MyApp.Accounts.form_to_update_user(params: %{"email" => "placeholder@email"})
#=> %AshPhoenix.Form{}
```
