module Exercise07 exposing (decoder)

import Json.Decode exposing (Decoder, fail)


{- This one is special.

   In the previous exercises, we've always used information from the javascript
   value to get to our result. Now, we won't!

   The exercise here, is to write a decoder that will always succeed with the
   string "sure."

   You've already seen what a decoder that always fails looks like, so it
   shouldn't be too hard; but it is _very_ important.

decoder : Decoder String
decoder =
    fail "I'd rather succeed, really."
