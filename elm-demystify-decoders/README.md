# Demystifying JSON decoders

Some people learn best by reading, others learn by best exploring and
experimenting. This project caters to the latter.

Decoding JSON in Elm can often feel daunting and difficult, even to experienced
developers. The exercises in this project attempt to guide you through JSON
decoding, by gradually increasing the level of complexity.

## Starting the exercises

- Clone this repository
- Install `elm` and `elm-test`
- Open the project in your editor

## Installing `elm` and `elm-test`

There are a couple of options. You can either install them globally, using `npm -g i elm elm-test` or using `yarn global add elm elm-test`, or locally in the scope of this project using either `npm i` or `yarn install`.

## Running the tests for a specific exercise

After solving an exercise, for example `Exercise01`, you can run the tests for
that exercise. The method you use will depend on how you chose to install `elm`
and `elm-test`:

- `elm-test tests/Exercise01` - if you installed it globally
- `npm run elm-test tests/Exercise01` - locally using `npm`
- `yarn elm-test tests/Exercise01` - locally using `yarn`
