# Rails Startup template

This is a template I use for my new Ruby on Rails 4 applications. **Pull requests are welcome.**

## How to Use

```bash
rails new [app_name] -m https://github.com/brianvanburken/rails_startup_template/template.rb
```

## What it does

Configures the Rails project right after creation.

## TODO

- Add Spork for faster testing
- Expand "What it does" section in README
- Add Zeus for faster commands!
