# Part 3

To build and run everything, `cd` into the `part3/` directory and run:

```shell
cargo run
```

This will compile your `src/main.rs` file into a binary executable, and
then immediately run it.

## Exercise

Open `src/main.rs` in your editor and resolve the TODOs there.

After you complete each one, re-run `cargo run` to
recompile and re-run the program, so you can see its new output!
