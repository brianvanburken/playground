**Question:** Binary search is significantly faster than the built-in search but
requires that the list is sorted. As you know, the running time for the best
sorting algorithm is on the order of N log2 N, where N is the length of the
list. If we search a lot of times on the same list of data, it makes sense to
sort it once before doing the searching. Roughly how many times do we need to
search in order to make sorting and then searching faster than using the
built-in search?

**Answer:**
