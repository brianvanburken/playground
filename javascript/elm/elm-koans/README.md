# Elm Koans

## Instructions
* Get [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/install) version 0.18
  * Make sure you have at least version 0.18.6 with `elm-test --version`
* Clone this repo
* Run the tests
  * **In the browser**
    * `elm reactor`
    * Visit http://localhost:8000/Main.elm
  * **Using Node**
    * `npm install -g elm-test`
    * `elm-test`
      * Note this will produce a LOT of output, so you'll probably want to `elm-test | head -n20` to just see the first couple failing tests
* Use any editor to change the source files, refresh the browser page, and make the tests pass
  * Placeholder values are denoted as `x____replace me____x` and will need to be replaced to make the tests pass
