## Exercises: Type Matching
Below you’ll find a list of several standard functions we’ve talked about
previously. Under that is a list of their type signatures. Match the function to
its type signature. Try to do it without peeking at the type signatures (either
in the text or in GHCi) and then check your work. You may find it easier to
start from the types and work out what you think a function of that type would do.


1. Functions:
a) c `not :: Bool -> Bool`
b) d `length :: [a] -> Int`
c) b `concat :: [[a]] -> [a]`
d) a `head :: [a] -> a`
e) e `(<) :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool`
